> Player 1 goes first. You can roll the dice however many times you 
wish. 
>In the ‘Current’ box, it gives you the current score as you roll the 
dice. 
>When it hits a certain score, player 1 may want to ‘hold’ the 
score, which will then appear in the middle of player 1 as the total 
score so for, player 1 cannot roll anymore. Player 2 begins to roll. 
> If the player hits ‘1’ without holding any score, the current score 
will reset, and the next player begins to roll again. 
> Once one of the players hits 20 or more score, that player wins!
